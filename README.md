After releasing HeliRace I thought it could be a good idea to make a Unity asset to help other developers who wish to simulate helicopters in their game. I am currently putting together scripts that allow just that with a simple drag n’ drop.

I changed how I simulate a helicopter behavior since I coded HeliRace. I now try to have something as realistic as possible.  Although it will be very easy for the user to simulate a helicopter by adding a single script and use default values for parameters, every single parameter is customizable. So it will be possible to simulate almost any helicopter. Only single rotor helicopters will be simulated in the first release.

Simple MFDs will also be included in the asset. Again a simple drag n’ drop will allow the use of pre-made PFD/ND.

Finally a 3D model (exterior and interior) will be included. It is mostly meant to make the demo scene more interesting but it will be available for users to put in their games if they wish to use it.

The following features will not be supported in the first release but could be implemented if there is demand from users.

– Radio altimiter

– Flight plan composed of Transforms displayed on the Navigation Display.

– Auto-pilot that could engage following modes :
– Heading
– Altitude
– Airspeed
– NAV (would follow the flight plan composed of Transforms at desired airspeed)
– Auto-Hover at desired position and altitude

– Tandem rotor helicopters simulation

Of course I need approval from Unity first!

Here are some screenshots.
